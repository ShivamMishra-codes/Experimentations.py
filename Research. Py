For your assignment:

"RAG is designed to give textual responses. Tweak it so that it should recognize images and give textual and image responses,"

I recommend submitting a solution that closely aligns with the true intent of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) while incorporating image recognition. Hereâ€™s a polished approach:

Final Submission Code

Below is a well-rounded code implementation that:

1. Uses retrieval to fetch documents based on the query (basic FAISS-based retrieval).


2. Incorporates image recognition using CLIP.


3. Generates textual responses combining retrieved text, image features, and query.

Why This Code?

1. True RAG Pipeline: Incorporates retrieval with FAISS and semantic search to fetch context dynamically.


2. Image Recognition: Processes images with CLIP and integrates features into text generation.


3. Text Generation: Combines retrieved text and image features into a single textual response.
